This practice file will be used
several times in this course.

Although I am created this file with the cat command,
later you will be editing it using vi.

vi permits global changes, reading/writing files, cutting and pasting, and 
tailoring the environment to meet individual needs.

There is no need for a mouse, you can keep your fingers where they belong, 
on the keyboard, everything is done through commands.

There are two commands that can be used to list directory contents-the dir and ls commands. 
The dir command has been added to Linux and is not a standard UNIX command. The ls command comes 
from the UNIX tradition and is the command you'll explore in this course.  
The ls command lists the files in a directory. This command takes several options and arguments. 

Line editors allow you to work with a line of text at a time. A screen editor displays an entire screen of text. 
A stream editor manipulates text as a stream of data, and is usually used in shell scripts, small programs 
written for and executed by the shell. The ex text editor is the foundation for vi, the screen editor we 
used in a previous module. You could call vi the visual mode of the underlying ex line editor. 
Ed is generally no longer used as a line editor because it has been superceded by ex, but some utilities 
like the diff command continue to use the ed syntax.

The screen editors vi and emacs are screen editors because you can view an entire screen of text for editing. 
You can see the changes you make as you make them. Because vi is a screen version of the ex editor, many of 
the ex commands can be used in vi. For example, you can still take advantage of the global replacement and 
pattern searches of the underlying ex editor when using vi. In fact, if you ever begin your vi command with: 
the colon, you are using an ex command in vi.  Remember the :q! command? It comes from vi's ex roots.

A stream editor is a non-interactive or stream-oriented editor. You do not view the text as you manipulate it. 
Instead, you give your commands to the editor which runs the commands as a batch. The standard input and 
standard output apply to a stream editor like many unix programs. You can of course redirect input and output 
for a stream editor. We will come back to stream editors later in the module, and look in detail at the sed stream editor.

The ex editor will return the name of file, the total number of lines & characters, and give you the : 
colon command prompt. You can also invoke the ex line editor in vi by typing a colon. An ex command, 
whether used in ex or in vi, consists of a line address, such as a line number, and a command. If 
you leave off the command, the print command (display to the screen) is assumed. For example, 
I could type 100 in the ex line editor and line 100 would display to the screen.
