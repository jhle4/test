    23	There is no need for a mouse, you can keep your fingers where they belong, 
    24	on the keyboard, everything is done through commands.
    25	
    26	There are two commands that can be used to list directory contents-the dir and ls commands. 
    27	The dir command has been added to Linux and is not a standard UNIX command. The ls command comes 
    28	from the UNIX tradition and is the command you'll explore in this course.  
    29	The ls command lists the files in a directory. This command takes several options and arguments. 
    30	
    31	Line editors allow you to work with a line of text at a time. A screen editor displays an entire screen of text. 
    32	A stream editor manipulates text as a stream of data, and is usually used in shell scripts, small programs 
    33	written for and executed by the shell. The ex text editor is the foundation for vi, the screen editor we 
    34	used in a previous module. You could call vi the visual mode of the underlying ex line editor. 
    35	Ed is generally no longer used as a line editor because it has been superceded by ex, but some utilities 
    36	like the diff command continue to use the ed syntax.
    37	
    38	The screen editors vi and emacs are screen editors because you can view an entire screen of text for editing. 
    39	You can see the changes you make as you make them. Because vi is a screen version of the ex editor, many of 
    40	the ex commands can be used in vi. For example, you can still take advantage of the global replacement and 
    41	pattern searches of the underlying ex editor when using vi. In fact, if you ever begin your vi command with: 
    42	the colon, you are using an ex command in vi.  Remember the :q! command? It comes from vi's ex roots.
    43	
    44	A stream editor is a non-interactive or stream-oriented editor. You do not view the text as you manipulate it. 
    45	Instead, you give your commands to the editor which runs the commands as a batch. The standard input and 
    46	standard output apply to a stream editor like many unix programs. You can of course redirect input and output 
    47	for a stream editor. We will come back to stream editors later in the module, and look in detail at the sed stream editor.
    48	
    49	This practice file will be used
    50	several times in this course.

    69	The ex editor will return the name of file, the total number of lines & characters, and give you the : 
    70	colon command prompt. You can also invoke the ex line editor in vi by typing a colon. An ex command, 
    71	whether used in ex or in vi, consists of a line address, such as a line number, and a command. If 
    72	you leave off the command, the print command (display to the screen) is assumed. For example, 
    73	I could type 100 in the ex line editor and line 100 would display to the screen.

The dir command has been added to Linux and is not a standard UNIX command. The 
ls command comes 
from the UNIX tradition and is the command you'll explore in this course.  
The ls command lists the files in a directory. This command takes several option
s and arguments. 

Line editors allow you to work with a line of text at a time. A screen editor di
splays an entire screen of text. 
A stream editor manipulates text as a stream of data, and is usually used in she
ll scripts, small programs 
written for and executed by the shell. The ex text editor is the foundation for 
vi, the screen editor we 
used in a previous module. You could call vi the visual mode of the underlying e
x line editor. 
[7m--More--(47%)[27mEd is generally no longer used as a line editor because it has been superceded b
y ex, but some utilities 
like the diff command continue to use the ed syntax.

The screen editors vi and emacs are screen editors because you can view an entir
e screen of text for editing. 
You can see the changes you make as you make them. Because vi is a screen versio
n of the ex editor, many of 
the ex commands can be used in vi. For example, you can still take advantage of 
the global replacement and 
pattern searches of the underlying ex editor when using vi. In fact, if you ever
 begin your vi command with: 
the colon, you are using an ex command in vi.  Remember the :q! command? It come
s from vi's ex roots.

A stream editor is a non-interactive or stream-oriented editor. You do not view 
the text as you manipulate it. 
Instead, you give your commands to the editor which runs the commands as a batch
. The standard input and 
standard output apply to a stream editor like many unix programs. You can of cou
rse redirect input and output 
for a stream editor. We will come back to stream editors later in the module, an
d look in detail at the sed stream editor.

whether used in ex or in vi, consists of a line address, such as a line number, 
and a command. If 
you leave off the command, the print command (display to the screen) is assumed.
 For example, 
I could type 100 in the ex line editor and line 100 would display to the screen.

THE DIR COMMAND HAS BEEN ADDED TO LINUX AND IS NOT A STANDARD UNIX COMMAND. THE LS COMMAND COMES 
FROM THE UNIX TRADITION AND IS THE COMMAND YOU'LL EXPLORE IN THIS COURSE.  
THE LS COMMAND LISTS THE FILES IN A DIRECTORY. THIS COMMAND TAKES SEVERAL OPTIONS AND ARGUMENTS. 

LINE EDITORS ALLOW YOU TO WORK WITH A LINE OF TEXT AT A TIME. A SCREEN EDITOR DISPLAYS AN ENTIRE SCREEN OF TEXT. 
A STREAM EDITOR MANIPULATES TEXT AS A STREAM OF DATA, AND IS USUALLY USED IN SHELL SCRIPTS, SMALL PROGRAMS 
WRITTEN FOR AND EXECUTED BY THE SHELL. THE EX TEXT EDITOR IS THE FOUNDATION FOR VI, THE SCREEN EDITOR WE 
USED IN A PREVIOUS MODULE. YOU COULD CALL VI THE VISUAL MODE OF THE UNDERLYING EX LINE EDITOR. 
ED IS GENERALLY NO LONGER USED AS A LINE EDITOR BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN SUPERCEDED BY EX, BUT SOME UTILITIES 
LIKE THE DIFF COMMAND CONTINUE TO USE THE ED SYNTAX.

THE SCREEN EDITORS VI AND EMACS ARE SCREEN EDITORS BECAUSE YOU CAN VIEW AN ENTIRE SCREEN OF TEXT FOR EDITING. 
YOU CAN SEE THE CHANGES YOU MAKE AS YOU MAKE THEM. BECAUSE VI IS A SCREEN VERSION OF THE EX EDITOR, MANY OF 
THE EX COMMANDS CAN BE USED IN VI. FOR EXAMPLE, YOU CAN STILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE GLOBAL REPLACEMENT AND 
PATTERN SEARCHES OF THE UNDERLYING EX EDITOR WHEN USING VI. IN FACT, IF YOU EVER BEGIN YOUR VI COMMAND WITH: 
THE COLON, YOU ARE USING AN EX COMMAND IN VI.  REMEMBER THE :Q! COMMAND? IT COMES FROM VI'S EX ROOTS.

A STREAM EDITOR IS A NON-INTERACTIVE OR STREAM-ORIENTED EDITOR. YOU DO NOT VIEW THE TEXT AS YOU MANIPULATE IT. 
INSTEAD, YOU GIVE YOUR COMMANDS TO THE EDITOR WHICH RUNS THE COMMANDS AS A BATCH. THE STANDARD INPUT AND 
STANDARD OUTPUT APPLY TO A STREAM EDITOR LIKE MANY UNIX PROGRAMS. YOU CAN OF COURSE REDIRECT INPUT AND OUTPUT 
FOR A STREAM EDITOR. WE WILL COME BACK TO STREAM EDITORS LATER IN THE MODULE, AND LOOK IN DETAIL AT THE SED STREAM EDITOR.

THIS PRACTICE FILE WILL BE USED
SEVERAL TIMES IN THIS COURSE.

ALTHOUGH I AM CREATED THIS FILE WITH THE CAT COMMAND,
LATER YOU WILL BE EDITING IT USING VI.

THE EX EDITOR WILL RETURN THE NAME OF FILE, THE TOTAL NUMBER OF LINES & CHARACTERS, AND GIVE YOU THE : 
COLON COMMAND PROMPT. YOU CAN ALSO INVOKE THE EX LINE EDITOR IN VI BY TYPING A COLON. AN EX COMMAND, 
WHETHER USED IN EX OR IN VI, CONSISTS OF A LINE ADDRESS, SUCH AS A LINE NUMBER, AND A COMMAND. IF 
YOU LEAVE OFF THE COMMAND, THE PRINT COMMAND (DISPLAY TO THE SCREEN) IS ASSUMED. FOR EXAMPLE, 
I COULD TYPE 100 IN THE EX LINE EDITOR AND LINE 100 WOULD DISPLAY TO THE SCREEN.

the ls command lists the files in a directory. this command takes several options and arguments. 

line editors allow you to work with a line of text at a time. a screen editor displays an entire screen of text. 
a stream editor manipulates text as a stream of data, and is usually used in shell scripts, small programs 
written for and executed by the shell. the ex text editor is the foundation for vi, the screen editor we 
used in a previous module. you could call vi the visual mode of the underlying ex line editor. 
ed is generally no longer used as a line editor because it has been superceded by ex, but some utilities 
like the diff command continue to use the ed syntax.

the screen editors vi and emacs are screen editors because you can view an entire screen of text for editing. 
you can see the changes you make as you make them. because vi is a screen version of the ex editor, many of 
the ex commands can be used in vi. for example, you can still take advantage of the global replacement and 
pattern searches of the underlying ex editor when using vi. in fact, if you ever begin your vi command with: 
the colon, you are using an ex command in vi.  remember the :q! command? it comes from vi's ex roots.

a stream editor is a non-interactive or stream-oriented editor. you do not view the text as you manipulate it. 
instead, you give your commands to the editor which runs the commands as a batch. the standard input and 
standard output apply to a stream editor like many unix programs. you can of course redirect input and output 
for a stream editor. we will come back to stream editors later in the module, and look in detail at the sed stream editor.

this practice file will be used
several times in this course.

although i am created this file with the cat command,
later you will be editing it using vi.

vi permits global changes, reading/writing files, cutting and pasting, and 
tailoring the environment to meet individual needs.

the ex editor will return the name of file, the total number of lines & characters, and give you the : 
colon command prompt. you can also invoke the ex line editor in vi by typing a colon. an ex command, 
whether used in ex or in vi, consists of a line address, such as a line number, and a command. if 
you leave off the command, the print command (display to the screen) is assumed. for example, 
i could type 100 in the ex line editor and line 100 would display to the screen.

can

your
fingers
where
they
belong,

on
the
keyboard,
everything
is
done
through
commands.

are

that

command

The

command
has

to
Linux
and
is
not
a

command.
The
ls
command
comes

from
the
UNIX
tradition
and
is
the
command
you'll
explore
in
this
course.


The
ls
command
lists
the
files
in
a
directory.
This
command
takes
several
options
and
arguments.


Line
editors
allow
you
to
work
with
a
line
of
text
at
a
time.
A
screen
editor
displays
an
entire
screen
of
text.

A
stream
editor
manipulates
text
as
a
stream
of
data,
and
is
usually
used
in
shell
scripts,
small
programs

written
for
and
executed
by
the
shell.
The
ex
text
editor
is
the
foundation
for
vi,
the
screen
editor
we

used
in
a
previous
module.
You
could
call
vi
the
visual
mode
of
the
underlying
ex
line
editor.

Ed
is
generally
no
longer
used
as
a
line
editor
because
it
has
been
superceded
by
ex,
but
some
utilities

like
the
diff
command
continue
to
use
the
ed
syntax.

The
screen
editors
vi
and
emacs
are
screen
editors
because
you
can
view
an
entire
screen
of
text
for
editing.

You
can
see
the
changes
you
make
as
you
make
them.
Because
vi
is
a
screen
version
of
the
ex
editor,
many
of

the
ex
commands
can
be
used
in
vi.
For
example,
you
can
still
take
advantage
of
the
global
replacement
and

pattern
searches
of
the
underlying
ex
editor
when
using
vi.
In
fact,
if
you
ever
begin
your
vi
command
with:

the
colon,
you
are
using
an
ex
command
in
vi.

Remember
the
:q!
command?
It
comes
from
vi's
ex
roots.

A
stream
editor
is
a
non-interactive
or
stream-oriented
editor.
You
do
not
view
the
text
as
you
manipulate
it.

Instead,
you
give
your
commands
to
the
editor
which
runs
the
commands
as
a
batch.
The
standard
input
and

standard
output
apply
to
a
stream
editor
like
many
unix
programs.
You
can
of
course
redirect
input
and
output

for
a
stream
editor.
We
will
come
back
to
stream
editors
later
in
the
module,
and
look
in
detail
at
the
sed
stream
editor.

This
practice
file
will
be
used
several
times
in
this
course.

Although
I
am
created
this
file
with

you
will

prompt.
You
can
also
invoke
the

by
typing

of
a

the dir command has been added to linux and is not a standard unix command. the ls command comes 
from the unix tradition and is the command you'll explore in this course.  
the ls command lists the files in a directory. this command takes several options and arguments. 

line editors allow you to work with a line of text at a time. a screen editor displays an entire screen of text. 
a stream editor manipulates text as a stream of data, and is usually used in shell scripts, small programs 
written for and executed by the shell. the ex text editor is the foundation for vi, the screen editor we 
used in a previous module. you could call vi the visual mode of the underlying ex line editor. 
ed is generally no longer used as a line editor because it has been superceded by ex, but some utilities 
like the diff command continue to use the ed syntax.

the screen editors vi and emacs are screen editors because you can view an entire screen of text for editing. 
you can see the changes you make as you make them. because vi is a screen version of the ex editor, many of 
the ex commands can be used in vi. for example, you can still take advantage of the global replacement and 
pattern searches of the underlying ex editor when using vi. in fact, if you ever begin your vi command with: 
the colon, you are using an ex command in vi.  remember the :q! command? it comes from vi's ex roots.

a stream editor is a non-interactive or stream-oriented editor. you do not view the text as you manipulate it. 
instead, you give your commands to the editor which runs the commands as a batch. the standard input and 
standard output apply to a stream editor like many unix programs. you can of course redirect input and output 
for a stream editor. we will come back to stream editors later in the module, and look in detail at the sed stream editor.

this practice file will be used
several times in this course.

although i am created this file with the cat command,
later you will be editing it using vi.

vi permits global changes, reading/writing files, cutting and pasting, and 
tailoring the environment to meet individual needs.

the ex editor will return the name of file, the total number of lines & characters, and give you the : 
colon command prompt. you can also invoke the ex line editor in vi by typing a colon. an ex command, 
whether used in ex or in vi, consists of a line address, such as a line number, and a command. if 
you leave off the command, the print command (display to the screen) is assumed. for example, 
i could type 100 in the ex line editor and line 100 would display to the screen.
